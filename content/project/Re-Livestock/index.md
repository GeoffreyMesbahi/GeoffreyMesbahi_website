The overall objective of Re-Livestock is to understand and mobilize adoption of innovative practices, applied cross-scale (animal, herd/farm, sector and region), to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of livestock farming and to increase the capacity for dealing with climate change impacts, in order to ultimately increase the overall resilience of the livestock sector. At FiBL, we work specifically on the fattening of organic dairy male calves: the effects of breed and grassland composition on meat productivity, methane emissions, economic benefit, land use, etc. More information: https://re-livestock.eu/
