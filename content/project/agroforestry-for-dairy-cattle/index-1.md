 This project aims to identify fodder trees and lianas for dairy cattle browsing. We study yield, nutritive value and appetence of 60 species in the OasYs experimental farm (Lusignan, France).

Summer droughts and heatwaves affect more and more grassland production in western Europe. In concequence, farmers have to offer hay or silage to dairy cattle, at the expense of winter stocks. Ligneous species could be an interesting alternative for fodder production. Ligneous species were planted between 2014 and 2016, and trees were pollarded to be directly browsed by cattle.
