This project aims to understand biotic and abiotic drivers of permanent grasslands characteristics.

We study traditional characteristics (e.g. yield, pastoral value, or botanical composition) but also original characteristics of fodder quality, ecology and carbon storage. We want to highlight interactions between characteristics, and see complementary effect of agronomy and ecology. The originality of this project remain in the high diversity of studied grasslands: soil properties, elevation and management grantly differ from one grassland to the other.  

This work is the the keystone of tools for grasslands decision makers. These tools inform about grassland characteristics and advise about grassland management.
