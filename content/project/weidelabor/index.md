This project aims to study the effect of four grassland mixtures on the productivity, nutritive value and palatability of the grass. To this end, we measured before every grazing rotation the yield, the nutritive value, the tannin content and the botanical composition. During the grazing we observed the feeding behaviour of the dairy cows.
