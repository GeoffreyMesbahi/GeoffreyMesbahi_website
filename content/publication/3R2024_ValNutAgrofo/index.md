abstract: "Against a backdrop of climate change, one of the major challenges facing ruminant breeders is to ensure the forage autonomy of their farms. Increasingly severe summer droughts are forcing farmers to draw on their forage stocks. This has led to a return to old practices, such as reinstating trees on farms. In addition to the ecosystem services provided to agrosystems via carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation or the creation of shade for animals, these woody plants can be used as fodder to supplement rations in times of shortage. In this study, we assessed the biochemical composition and digestibility of the leaves and stems of four agroforestry tree species to better characterize their forage value. We found higher crude protein concentration, in vitro digestibility and calcium composition in the leaves of all species, and conversely, higher NDF, ADF and ADL in the stems. These results are close to those found in the literature for tree leaves. To our knowledge, there are very few studies indicating the nutritional value of tree stems, and these are often small-diameter stems. Other parameters need to be taken into account when assessing the nutritional value of trees. Furthermore, not all the stems collected in this study would be consumed by cattle. These results need to be refined with the portion of stems actually consumed."
