abstract: "Grasslands are at the heart of multiple expectations on the part of farmers and society. The objective of this study was to assess the services provided by semi-natural grasslands, and the trade-offs between these services. Starting from a survey of 150 grasslands in the Vosges massif, we selected 58 that have been monitored for 2 consecutive years (2018-2019). Grassland services were assessed through measurements (M) and indicator calculations (IND) including dry matter production (M), feed value and anti-oxidant content of grass (M), physicochemical composition of the soil (M), carbon sequestration (M), floristic biodiversity (M), cost of production and replacement (M), product quality (cheese and meat) (IND), animal health (IND), pollinator value (IND), ecological conservation status (IND). The study of the trade-offs between these services shows that there is no binary opposition between economic value and environmental value. On the contrary, certain environmental services may be associated with the economic interest of livestock farmers."
