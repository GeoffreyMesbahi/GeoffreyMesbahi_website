abstract: "European permanent grasslands are the main source of livestock fodder and the main hotspot of
botanical diversity, but the trade-offs between fodder production and botanical diversity conservation
remain debated. This study aims to identify what grassland features influence fodder characteristics and
to estimate the direction of correlation between biodiversity and fodder characteristics. We focused
on a diverse sample of 58 permanent grasslands from the Vosges Mountains (eastern France). For each
grassland, we estimated the quantity and quality of the fodder using 10 fodder characteristics, and
extracted 26 grassland features related to management, environment, and taxonomic and functional
diversity. We used random forest algorithms to investigate what grassland features best predicted fodder
characteristics. Our results showed that fodder characteristics could be well estimated using only 14
grassland features (R2>0.4) pertaining to management, soil, climate, taxonomic and functional diversity.
Diversity was negatively correlated to three fodder characteristics, but positively correlated to six. We
conclude that biodiversity is a key predictor of grassland fodder characteristics, and enhances most of
them. We argue that conservation of permanent grassland biodiversity and agricultural production can
both benefit from synergies."
