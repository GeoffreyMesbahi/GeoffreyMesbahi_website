abstract: "Agroforestry is an age-old agroecological practice with a promising future, and it has the potential to be a major ally in the development of organic farming. Animals have much to gain from living in the shade of trees and eating their leaves and fruit. Conversely, trees can benefit from the presence of animals. Nevertheless, certain adaptations may be necessary, and the increased complexity of farming systems raises new challenges."
