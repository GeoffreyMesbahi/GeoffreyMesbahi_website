abstract: "Pasture-based veal production offers potential benefits in terms of animal welfare and resource
efficiency compared to conventional indoor systems. This study evaluated the performance of 72 male
veal calves from three breeds: Brown Swiss, Brown Swiss × Limousin, and Swiss Fleckvieh, raised across
four environments: a control group housed indoors and three grazing systems typical from the Swiss
landscapes—intensive grasslands, permanent grasslands, and alpine grasslands. All calves on pasture
were fed with similar quantities of maize and alfalfa pellets, as well as soy-free concentrate in limited
amounts, while the control group had a slightly different feeding plan. Hay was provided ad libitum
across all systems. Intensive grasslands were characterized by a higher portion of grasses, compared to
permanent and alpine grasslands. Energy content of alpine grassland was higher compared to intensive
and permanent grasslands in this study, whereas the protein content was higher at the intensive
grasslands compared to the alpine grasslands. Significant differences were observed in performance
metrics based on farm type, breed, and carcass traits. Carcass weights differed significantly among
systems, with the indoor housed calves yielding the heaviest carcasses. Average Daily Gain (ADG) also
varied significantly by systems, with indoor calves achieving the highest ADG and calves at permanent
grasslands the lowest, while calves on alpine and intensive grasslands exhibited similar ADG levels. Breed
did not affect carcass weights nor ADG, but it showed significant effects on mean maximum Warner-
Bratzler Shear Force with Swiss Fleckvieh having lower values than Brown Swiss. These findings
underscore the influence of management and environmental factors on growth and meat quality traits
in veal production. However, additional data on meat quality after 8 days of maturation and economic
calculations are needed to fully assess the feasibility of grass-based veal production."
