abstract: "Platyrrhini are highly vulnerable to the yellow fever (YF) virus. From 2016 to 2018, the Atlantic Forest of southeast Brazil faced its worst sylvatic YF outbreak in about a century, thought to have killed thousands of primates. It is essential to assess the impact of this epidemic on threatened primate assemblages to design effective conservation strategies. In this study, we assessed the impact of the 2016–2018 YF outbreak on a geographically isolated population of Near Threatened black‐fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons) in two Atlantic Forest patches of the Santuário do Caraça, MG, Brazil. Extensive preoutbreak monitoring, conducted between 2008 and 2016, revealed that the home range and group sizes of the population remained stable. In 2016, the population size was estimated at 53–57 individuals in 11–12 groups. We conducted monitoring and playback surveys in 2019 and found that the population had decreased by 68% in one forest patch and completely vanished in the other, resulting in a combined decline of 80%. We discuss this severe loss of a previously stable population and conclude that it was highly likely caused by the YF outbreak. The remaining population is at risk of disappearing completely because of its small size and geographic isolation. A systematic population surveys of C. nigrifrons, along other sensible Platyrrhini species, is needed to re‐evaluate their current conservation status."
