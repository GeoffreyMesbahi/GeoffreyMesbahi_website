abstract: "At the Santuário do Caraça, the 2016 yellow fever outbreak killed 80% of the studied titi monkey population. To sensibilise visitors to this monkey species and to the importance of human vaccination, we produced interpretive signs, poster and social media posts in collaboration with the Santuário do Caraça. These communication tools are produced in Portuguese to address local population, and as much as possible in English to sensibilise foreign visitors."
